      <p class="paragraph text-left">Complexity and contrast are the keynotes of life in Japan—a country possessing an intricate and ancient cultural tradition yet one that, since 1950, has emerged as one of the world’s most economically and technologically advanced societies.</p>
      <p class="paragraph text-left">
      Heavy emphasis is placed on education, and Japan is one of the world’s most literate countries. Tension between old and new is apparent in all phases of Japanese life.</p>
      <p class="paragraph text-left">
      A characteristic sensitivity to natural beauty and a concern with form and balance are evident in such cities as Kyōto and Nara, as well as in Japan’s ubiquitous gardens. Even in the countryside, however, the impact of rapid Westernization is evident in many aspects of Japanese life.</p>

      <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">People</h1>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">The Japanese people constitute the overwhelming majority of the population. During the Edo (Tokugawa) period (1603–1867), there was a social division of the populace into four classes—warrior, farmer, craftsman, and merchant—with a peer class above and an outcast class below.</p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">Insofar as a social class system does persist, it does not have the ethnic basis that can exist in multiracial societies, since the Japanese regard themselves as belonging to a single ethnic group. The few exceptions include those classified as resident aliens (particularly Koreans) and Japanese citizens of Ainu and, to a much lesser degree, Okinawan origin. Japan also has a small population of Chinese descent.</p>

        <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">Japanese Language</h1>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          The introduction of the Chinese writing system and of Chinese literature about the 4th century CE enriched the Japanese vocabulary. Until that time Japanese had no written form, and at first Chinese characters (called <br>kanji "漢字" in Japanese) were used to write Japanese; by the 9th century two syllabaries, known collectively as kana (katakana "カタカナ" and hiragana <br>"ひらがな"), were developed from them. Since then, a combination of kanji and kana has been used for written Japanese.

        <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">Religion</h1>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          The indigenous religion of Japan, Shintō, coexists with various sects of Buddhism, Christianity, and some ancient shamanistic practices, as well as a number of “new religions” that have emerged since the 19th century. Thus, it is typical for one person or family to believe in several Shintō gods and at the same time belong to a Buddhist sect.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Shintō is a polytheistic religion. People, commonly major historical figures, as well as natural objects have been enshrined as gods. Some of the Hindu gods and Chinese spirits were also introduced and Japanized.

        <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">The Arts</h1>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Traditional handicrafts constitute some of Japan’s finest examples of visual arts. Notable are the various styles of pottery, lacquerwork, cloisonné, and bamboo ware, as well as papermaking, silk weaving, and cloth dyeing.<br>
          Western art forms have been fully embraced by the Japanese. Major cities often have several symphony orchestras, and Western-style painting, sculpture, and architecture are widely practiced.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          The national government’s Agency for Cultural Affairs (established 1968) is responsible for promoting and disseminating different aspects of culture, as well as preserving cultural properties and historical sites. Of particular note is the agency’s practice of identifying and recognizing various artists, performers, and artisans of traditional Japanese art forms.<br>
          Japan is home to more than a dozen UNESCO World Heritage sites. Most reflect the country’s rich cultural traditions, including the historic monuments at Kyōto and Nara (designated in 1993 and 1998, respectively).

        <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">Education</h1>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Japan’s modern education system has been a key element in the country’s emergence as a highly industrialized country. The social and economic benefits of education long have been recognized in Japan, and education has been seen as the all-important means to achieve personal advancement. Thus, attending the “right” schools tends to become the critical factor in determining an individual’s ultimate social status and earning power.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Higher education is greatly desired. The rigorous high-school curriculum is largely designed as preparation for the difficult and highly competitive university entrance examinations, which are given once per year. The two great former imperial universities—Tokyo and Kyōto—represent the pinnacle of academic success, and competition to enter one of them is particularly intense.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">Most high-school students attend one of the large number of extracurricular “cram” schools (juku) that help them prepare for the examinations. High-school graduates who do not pass the examinations on their first attempt often study intensively for a year and retake the tests.

        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Contemporary Japanese society is decidedly urban. Not only do the vast majority of Japanese live in urban settings, but urban culture is transmitted throughout the country by a mass media largely concentrated in Tokyo. Young urban Japanese in particular have become known for their conspicuous consumption and their penchant for trends and fads that quickly go in and out of fashion.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Japanese cuisine, which often is served raw or only lightly cooked, is noted for its subtle and delicate flavours. Perhaps the best-known dish worldwide is sushi— cooked, vinegared rice served with a variety of vegetable, sashimi (raw seafood), and egg garnishes and formed into various shapes; in addition, sashimi is commonly served on its own.<br>
          Japan is renowned for its green tea, much of it cultivated on or near the slopes of Mount Fuji in Shizuoka prefecture. Sake, a brewed alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice, is also especially associated with Japan, where typically it is served heated in small porcelain cups.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Japan has 15 national holidays. New Year’s Day is traditionally regarded as the most important of these holidays, with millions of people engaging in a kind of pilgrimage to shrines and temples starting at midnight of December 31. <br>
          The Japanese have a great fondness for seasonal blossom and leaf viewing. Most popular are the cherry blossoms of spring (in some areas, around Golden Week).
