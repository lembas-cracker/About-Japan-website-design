      <p class="paragraph text-left">Complexity and contrast are the keynotes of life in Japan—a country possessing an intricate and ancient cultural tradition yet one that, since 1950, has emerged as one of the world’s most economically and technologically advanced societies.</p>
      <p class="paragraph text-left">
      Heavy emphasis is placed on education, and Japan is one of the world’s most literate countries. Tension between old and new is apparent in all phases of Japanese life.</p>
      <p class="paragraph text-left">
      A characteristic sensitivity to natural beauty and a concern with form and balance are evident in such cities as Kyōto and Nara, as well as in Japan’s ubiquitous gardens. Even in the countryside, however, the impact of rapid Westernization is evident in many aspects of Japanese life.</p>

      <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">People</h1>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">The Japanese people constitute the overwhelming majority of the population. During the Edo (Tokugawa) period (1603–1867), there was a social division of the populace into four classes—warrior, farmer, craftsman, and merchant—with a peer class above and an outcast class below.</p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">Insofar as a social class system does persist, it does not have the ethnic basis that can exist in multiracial societies, since the Japanese regard themselves as belonging to a single ethnic group. The few exceptions include those classified as resident aliens (particularly Koreans) and Japanese citizens of Ainu and, to a much lesser degree, Okinawan origin. Japan also has a small population of Chinese descent.</p>

        <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">Japanese Language</h1>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          The introduction of the Chinese writing system and of Chinese literature about the 4th century CE enriched the Japanese vocabulary. Until that time Japanese had no written form, and at first Chinese characters (called <br>kanji "漢字" in Japanese) were used to write Japanese; by the 9th century two syllabaries, known collectively as kana (katakana "カタカナ" and hiragana <br>"ひらがな"), were developed from them. Since then, a combination of kanji and kana has been used for written Japanese.

        <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">Religion</h1>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          The indigenous religion of Japan, Shintō, coexists with various sects of Buddhism, Christianity, and some ancient shamanistic practices, as well as a number of “new religions” that have emerged since the 19th century. Thus, it is typical for one person or family to believe in several Shintō gods and at the same time belong to a Buddhist sect.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Shintō is a polytheistic religion. People, commonly major historical figures, as well as natural objects have been enshrined as gods. Some of the Hindu gods and Chinese spirits were also introduced and Japanized.

        <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">The Arts</h1>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Traditional handicrafts constitute some of Japan’s finest examples of visual arts. Notable are the various styles of pottery, lacquerwork, cloisonné, and bamboo ware, as well as papermaking, silk weaving, and cloth dyeing.<br>
          Western art forms have been fully embraced by the Japanese. Major cities often have several symphony orchestras, and Western-style painting, sculpture, and architecture are widely practiced.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          The national government’s Agency for Cultural Affairs (established 1968) is responsible for promoting and disseminating different aspects of culture, as well as preserving cultural properties and historical sites. Of particular note is the agency’s practice of identifying and recognizing various artists, performers, and artisans of traditional Japanese art forms.<br>
          Japan is home to more than a dozen UNESCO World Heritage sites. Most reflect the country’s rich cultural traditions, including the historic monuments at Kyōto and Nara (designated in 1993 and 1998, respectively).

        <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">Education</h1>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Japan’s modern education system has been a key element in the country’s emergence as a highly industrialized country. The social and economic benefits of education long have been recognized in Japan, and education has been seen as the all-important means to achieve personal advancement. Thus, attending the “right” schools tends to become the critical factor in determining an individual’s ultimate social status and earning power.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Higher education is greatly desired. The rigorous high-school curriculum is largely designed as preparation for the difficult and highly competitive university entrance examinations, which are given once per year. The two great former imperial universities—Tokyo and Kyōto—represent the pinnacle of academic success, and competition to enter one of them is particularly intense.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">Most high-school students attend one of the large number of extracurricular “cram” schools (juku) that help them prepare for the examinations. High-school graduates who do not pass the examinations on their first attempt often study intensively for a year and retake the tests.

        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Contemporary Japanese society is decidedly urban. Not only do the vast majority of Japanese live in urban settings, but urban culture is transmitted throughout the country by a mass media largely concentrated in Tokyo. Young urban Japanese in particular have become known for their conspicuous consumption and their penchant for trends and fads that quickly go in and out of fashion.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Japanese cuisine, which often is served raw or only lightly cooked, is noted for its subtle and delicate flavours. Perhaps the best-known dish worldwide is sushi— cooked, vinegared rice served with a variety of vegetable, sashimi (raw seafood), and egg garnishes and formed into various shapes; in addition, sashimi is commonly served on its own.<br>
          Japan is renowned for its green tea, much of it cultivated on or near the slopes of Mount Fuji in Shizuoka prefecture. Sake, a brewed alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice, is also especially associated with Japan, where typically it is served heated in small porcelain cups.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Japan has 15 national holidays. New Year’s Day is traditionally regarded as the most important of these holidays, with millions of people engaging in a kind of pilgrimage to shrines and temples starting at midnight of December 31. <br>
          The Japanese have a great fondness for seasonal blossom and leaf viewing. Most popular are the cherry blossoms of spring (in some areas, around Golden Week).

      <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">Government</h1>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
        Japan is divided into 47 prefectures, 43 of which are ken (prefectures proper); of the remainder, Tokyo is a to (metropolitan prefecture), Hokkaido is a dō (district), and Ōsaka and Kyōto are fu (urban prefectures). Prefectures, which are administered by governors and assemblies, vary considerably both in area and in population. The largest prefecture is Hokkaido, with an area of 32,221 square miles (83,453 square km), while the smallest is Kagawa, with 724 square miles (1,876 square km).
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
        Prefectures are further subdivided into minor civil divisions; these include shi (cities), machi or chō (towns), and mura or son (villages). All these local government units have their own mayors, or chiefs, and assemblies. In addition, a city that has a population of at least 500,000 can be given the status of shitei toshi (designated city). Designated cities are divided into ku (wards), each of which has a chief and an assembly, the former being nominated by the mayor and the latter elected by the residents.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
        The judiciary is completely independent of the executive and legislative branches of the government. The judicial system consists of three levels: the Supreme Court, eight high (appellate) courts, and a district court and a family court in each prefecture (except for Hokkaido, which has four). <br>
        The Supreme Court consists of a chief justice and 14 other justices. The chief justice is appointed by the emperor upon designation by the cabinet, while the other justices are appointed by the cabinet.

      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
        Japan’s constitution was promulgated in 1946 and came into force in 1947, superseding the Meiji Constitution of 1889. It differs from the earlier document in two fundamental ways: the principle of sovereignty and the stated aim of maintaining Japan as a peaceful and democratic country in perpetuity. The emperor, rather than being the embodiment of all sovereign authority, is the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people.
      </p>
       <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
         The government is now based on a constitution that stipulates the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The emperor’s major role now consists of such formalities as appointing the prime minister—who is first designated by the Diet (Kokkai)—and appointing the chief justice of the Supreme Court (Saikō Saibansho), convoking sessions of the Diet, promulgating laws and treaties, and awarding state honours—all with the advice and approval of the cabinet (naikaku).

      <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">Economy</h1>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
        Japan is remarkable for its extraordinarily rapid rate of economic growth in the 20th century, especially in the first several decades after World War II. This growth was based on unprecedented expansion of industrial production and the development of an enormous domestic market, as well as on an aggressive export trade policy. <br>
        The service sector has come to dominate the economy in terms of its overall proportion of the gross domestic product (GDP) and of employment.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
        Coal, iron ore, zinc, lead, copper, sulfur, gold, and silver are among the most abundant minerals (in relative terms), with lesser quantities of tungsten, chromite, and manganese. Japan also has large deposits of limestone.<br>
        The rate of Japan’s consumption of energy leveled off in the mid-1990s, after having increased steadily for decades. Per capita consumption of electricity is comparable to that for most industrialized countries, but that for oil and natural gas is considerably lower.<br>
        Most of Japan’s total electric power is generated by thermal plants.

        Reasons for this spectacular export performance are the wide variety of Japan’s industrial output, the shift to products with a relatively high value added, the country’s export competitiveness, and the dominant position of its industry in a number of fields. However, Japanese exports face increasing challenges. Most notable is strong competition from Japan’s industrial neighbours China, South Korea, and Taiwan, as well as from the countries of Southeast Asia.
      </p>
       <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
         Other factors include protectionist sentiments among Japan’s chief trading partners, the valuation of the yen compared with that of other currencies, and a falloff in exports caused by the increased production of Japanese companies abroad.

      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
        Much of the original vegetation has been replaced by agriculture or by the introduction of foreign species to the islands.<br>
        The laurel forest zone of evergreen, broad-leaved trees extends from the southwestern islands northward to the lowlands of northern Honshu. Camphor, pasanias, Japanese evergreen oaks, camellias, and hollies are typical trees, with various kinds of ferns as undergrowth.<br>
        The coastal dunes are dominated by pine trees. Natural stands of Japanese cedars, some containing trees that are more than 2,000 years old, occur above 2,300 feet (700 metres).
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
        Despite the country’s large human population, the land mammals of Japan are relatively numerous in the remote, heavily forested mountain regions. These animals include bears, wild boars, raccoon dogs (tanuki), foxes, deer (including sikas), antelope, hares, and weasels; some species are distinct from those of the neighbouring Asian continent. Wild monkeys (the Japanese macaque) inhabit many places.<br>
        Insect life is typical of a temperate humid climate; several species have seasonal associations in literature and popular culture, such as cicadas and dragonflies (summer) and crickets (autumn).
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">The confluence of cold and warm ocean currents near Japan has produced a rich sea life. Japanese waters are inhabited by whales, dolphins, porpoises, and fish such as salmon, sardines, sea bream, mackerel, tuna, trout, herring, gray mullet, smelts, and cod. Crustaceans and mollusks include crabs, shrimp, prawns, clams, and oysters. </p>

      <h1 class="heading-drawer-1 text-center">Climate</h1>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
        In general, Japan’s climate is characterized as monsoonal (i.e., governed by wet and dry seasonal winds). The main influences are the country’s latitudinal extent, the surrounding oceans, and its proximity to the neighbouring Asian landmass. <br>
        The physical feature that most affects climate is the mountainous backbone of the islands. The ranges interrupt the monsoonal winds and cause the gloomy weather and heavy snows of winter along the Sea of Japan coast and the bright and windy winter weather along the Pacific.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
        Precipitation in the form of rain and snow is plentiful throughout the islands. Maximum precipitation falls in the early summer, and the minimum occurs in winter—except on the Sea of Japan coast, which receives the country’s highest snowfall. The summer rainy season occurs through June and July; it is known as the baiu (“plum rain”) because it begins when the plums ripen. Torrential rains accompany the typhoons.

      <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
        The national treasure, hot springs are dotted all across the country. Japanese have really embraced this natural wonder and turned it into an inseparable part of culture. The springs can be enjoyed outside as well as inside in the spa center. Even the monkeys enjoy them in the parks!
      </p>
       <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
         Regarded as one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Japan, Shiraito is found near Mount Fuji and Five Fuji Lakes. The spring from the iconic volcano plunges here in a horse-show shaped cascade, creating this scenic view, which can be approached from a bridge.
       </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
          Nachi Falls.<br>
          At 436 feet (133 m) it is the tallest waterfall in Japan. The single drop stream plunges down a rocky wall. Seiganto-ji – a Buddhist temple – stands in the backdrop of the waterfall adding an extra charm and mystique to the place.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">Kerama Islands.
        A group of 22 islands are relatively close to Okinawa and provide an amazing vacation paradise. Only four of them are inhabited, leaving a lot of space for adventure travel and admiring unspoiled nature. The islands boast great beaches and versatile marine life, which attracts divers. The humpback whales can be observed in winter.</p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">Found in the Northern Alps of Kita, Mount Yari is one of the most famous and beautiful in Japan. It is popular among the backpackers, who take a challenge to climb 40 km to its peak. The landscapes are breathtaking and there are various lodges as well, providing accommodation as well as facilities.</p>
         <p class="paragraph paragraph-drawer1 text-left col-11">
           The tallest mountain in Japan, Fuji also carries a long historical and cultural importance. The volcano has shaped the landscape here and is a pilgrimage site, attracting not only pilgrims however, but the tourists as well.
